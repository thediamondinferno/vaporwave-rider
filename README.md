Thank you for the given chance to work on such a cool challenge and become the winner even!

The build is messy, but hopefully, will become polished and made into a proper game very soon.

All the scripts are in the scripts folder and the rest is less important I think, enjoy ;3

Andrija out

P.S. due to LFS not working for non-enterprise github, was forced to create my own project and not just fork it and branch it out over the main.
